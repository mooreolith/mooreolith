# Welcome

I'm Josh, I write software as a hobby. Previously did it for a living. 

I've been tinkering on this app for a little bit now: 
[es.ipynb app](https://mooreolith.github.io/es.ipynb)/[es.ipynb source](https://github.com/mooreolith/es.ipynb) is a notebook for browser-side javascript. It runs entirely in your browser. Upload, edit and download .es.ipynb files.
Notebooks can now be loaded via URL (watch out for same-origin).

Here is an example evolution of a simple todo app:
  1. [todo-db](https://github.com/mooreolith/todo-db) (mysql+expressjs) This is the version I would write if I were to write everything myself. 
  2. [todo-docker](https://github.com/mooreolith/todo-docker) (docker-compose) Docker-compose is like a software forklift. 
  3. [todo](https://mooreolith.github.io/todo) (gh-pages version) This is the version I actually use. 
Enjoy!
