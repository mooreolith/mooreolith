# Hi, 

You have found the developer portfolio page of Joshua M. Moore. It's a good thing you came here, too, because https://verticesandedges.net is still under construction.

Some of my more recent projects include

* [Graph App](https://mooreolith.github.io/graph-app/): Create a dynamic graph visualization using Javascript or GUI. (also [here](https://apps.verticesandedges.net/editor/))
* [Notebook](https://mooreolith.github.io/notebook/): A client-side Javascript Notebook. (also [here](https://apps.verticesandedges.net/notebook/))
* [Eight Queens Riddle](https://mooreolith.github.io/eight-queens/): Place eight queens on an empty chess board so that no two pieces threaten each other. (also [here](https://apps.verticesandedges.net/eight-queens/))

I've been developing Javascript applications since around 2010, first as an unsuccessful freelancer, later at a string of software companies. If you'd like to hire someone who's been out of work since the pandemic started, (or just wanna chat), please feel free to email me at [joshua.moore@verticesandedges.net](mailto:joshua.moore@verticesandedges.net).

Thank you for your time.
