### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm mooreolith, eldest for many moons. 

Rather than talk about myself a whole lot, I'd like to make a list of cool websites:

* https://github.com, Thank you, github, for many years of page hosting.
* https://stackoverflow.com a question and answer site for people there to get answers to questions, rather than socialize. Come prepared with a question, what you've done to solve it, and what your remaining question is, after googling all your questions. It helps to make an isolated version of the error program you're encountering, something minimal that reproduces the error, which is a skill you learn as a software tester. 
* https://developer.mozilla.org (MDN) is a comprehensive, human readable HTML5 reference and tutorial. Look up specific functions, or read about a minimal approach to solving a problem, which you can weave into your own development. 
* https://heroku.com, github's static page hosting is great, and with the option to redirect a domain here, it's the perfect choice for hosting static webpages. But heroku offers something a step up: free nodejs cloud hosted servers interacting, from the database layer to the nodejs server application, or other addons that aren't too terribly priced.
* https://news.ycombinator.com. Every once in a while, someone introduces something really cool. Other than that, it seems like the gently recurring software circle chatter.

Answers to Github questions meant to help me get started:
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ... getting the graph visualization to work. I'm trying a mathier way than usual, and might use a python solver to minimize some of the layout calculation doing things I don't understand. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... Nothing. I'm reading a Latin American scifi novel for children.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ... THe graph. 
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ... How to optimize variables for a randomize system of n initial configurations... do I introduce metrics? or do I continue on with percent impact on system? 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ... how a single math paper can take me over a decade to replicate?
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: mooreolith@gmail.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he, they, the voices and I, we really don't care. Don't be an idiot, and don't be rude. 
- âš¡ Fun fact: There' so many!
