## Take a look around
I develop software as a hobby. It's a skill I learned in and after university, almost even graduating. My pet project is a web component featuring a force directed graph visualization. I think looking at abstract layers of our world in 3D graphs would be pretty cool. 

* layout is the project I'm currently working on.
* social-cartography is a prototype for a graph editor I wrote a long time ago. 
* eight-queens was a project commemorating my late father.
* fourdd is an early prototype of what I'm going for with layout.
* es.ipynb is a concept notebook, kinda like jupyter, with markdown and code cells, but the code cells are javascript. I had a version that could also modify the server its running on, but I can't find that any more.
* genetic-algorithm-notebook is an exercise in genetic programming, a precursor to machine learning in a way, in that it introduces a loss function.
* graph-visualization must be an old prototype.
* fourd.cpp.js old prototype.

If you have questions about any of these, feel free to open an issue.
