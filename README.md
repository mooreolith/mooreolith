# Welcome

I'm Josh, I write software as a hobby. Previously did it for a living. 

I've been tinkering on this app for a little bit now: 
[es.ipynb app](https://mooreolith.github.io/es.ipynb)/[es.ipynb source](https://github.com/mooreolith/es.ipynb) is a notebook for browser-side javascript. It runs entirely in your browser. Upload, edit and download .es.ipynb files.
Notebooks can now be loaded via URL (watch out for same-origin). For example: [this notebook](https://mooreolith.github.io/es.ipynb/?url=https://mooreolith.github.io/es.ipynb/example/Vega%20Streaming%20Data%20Experiment.es.ipynb).
