Hello, my name is Josh Moore. 

I'm a software developer from Bamberg, Germany. I currently live in the greater Las Vegas area. I almost completed college, but the fates wouldn't have it. Since then I've been writing Javascript, SQL and C# and Python, even some PHP and VB.Net! Besides programming, I enjoy listening to music, taking pictures, and swimming. 

Some ways to reach me are:
