I like web stuff.

* [Notebook](https://mooreolith.github.io/notebook/): A Jupyter-like notebook for client side Javascript.
* [Graph App](https://mooreolith.github.io/graph-app/): Script network graphs in Javascript.
* [Eight Queens Riddle](https://mooreolith.github.io/eight-queens/): Place Eight Queens on a chess board so that no two queens threaten each other.
