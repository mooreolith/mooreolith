# Welcome

I'm Josh, I write software as a hobby. Previously did it for a living. 

Some of the latest two: 
 * [es.ipynb](https://mooreolith.github.io/es.ipynb) is a notebook for browser-side javascript. It runs entirely in your browser. Upload, edit and download .es.ipynb files. 
 * [todo](https://github.com/mooreolith/todo) is a simple [todo app](https://mooreolith.github.io/todo) for demonstration purposes. There's also [todo-db](https://github.com/mooreolith/todo-db) and [todo-docker](https://github.com/mooreolith/todo-docker). 

Enjoy!
