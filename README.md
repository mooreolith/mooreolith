Welcome to this Joshua Moore’s portfolio page. I’m a Las Vegas based software developer mainly handcrafting Vanilla Javascript, CSS, and HTML. These are a few recent rewrites and new additions. 
* [Eight Queens](https://mooreolith.github.io/eight-queens)
My late father (may he rest in peace) passed down to me his love for chess, and a riddle called the Eight Queens Problem. The aim is to place eight queens (which can move up/down, left/right, and diagonally, you can use 8 pawns) on a chess board so that no queen can capture another. Click the fields to place a queen, click it again, to remove it. Trial and error it, or reason it out. There are multiple solutions.

* [Notebook](https://mooreolith.github.io/notebook)
Born out of the need to conduct small experiments when implementing larger projects, I found myself wanting for a javascript notebook. The Jupyter Notebook which inspired this project deals with server side languages, whereas I specifically wanted something for client side (browser) Javascript. The two following links contain references to two example notebooks. 
  * [Javascript MicroGrad Notebook](https://mooreolith.github.io/notebook/?url=./notebooks/MicroGrad.ipynb)
    MicroGrad is a teaching neural network developed originally by Andrej Karpathy in python. I translated the python to javascript.
  * [Golem Population Notebook](https://mooreolith.github.io/notebook/?url=./notebooks/golem-population.ipynb)
    A fictional society of golems, affecting each other’s health by speaking to each other, and reacting to extreme health (0 or 100) by dying or multiplynig. This notebook demonstrates loading an externally hosted library (here vega-lite) and accessing the notebook’s output to append a dynamic data visualization.
* [Soundtrack](https://mooreolith.github.io/soundtrack)
  Soundtrack is a browser based mp3 player. This program grew out of my frustration with ever so slightly off feature sets in various browsers. They all do the basics, and many others have more features, but this is just what I need: A list of mp3 tracks from my hard drive I can play, filtered by artist, album or title. Upload a folder to the app (nothing leaves your browser), wait for the mp3 files to parse, and double click a song to start playback.
