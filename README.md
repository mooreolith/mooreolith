# Welcome

I'm Josh, I write software as a hobby. Previously did it for a living. 

Some of the latest two: 
 * [todo-app](https://github.com/mooreolith/todo-app), you'll find a description of 3-Tier architecture using a CRUD app: todo-app
 * [todo-app-docker](https://github.com/mooreolith/todo-app-docker), containerizes the previous todo app
 * [todo-app-indexeddb](https://github.com/mooreolith/todo-app-indexeddb), a web only version of this todo app

Here's a new one: 
 * [es.ipynb](https://mooreolith.github.io/es.ipynb) is a notebook for browser-side javascript.

Enjoy!
