Hi. Thanks for stopping by. While you're here, why not take a look at 
* [layout](https://github.com/mooreolith/layout), which is a simple and inefficient layout calculation,
  but one that can serve as the basis for added optimizations. I'm still following the 2007 Veldhuizen
  paper, but slower. I reimplemented the vector operations, so that a position, a velocity, an
  acceleration is a list of three numbers. Everything in here is commented, and everything in here is  

other projects:
* [eight queens](https://mooreolith.github.io/eight-queens) an eight queens riddle with some solutions.
* [es.ipynb](https://mooreolith.github.io/es.ipynb) a crude localStorage notebook for browser javascript.
