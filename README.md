# Welcome to my Github Page
My name is Joshua Moore. I live in North Las Vegas, but I'm originally from Germany, and am open to work, after some time away during the pandemic. I write vanilla JavaScript and am begrudgingly learning to switch from AngularJS to AngularIO. AFter dropping out of school, I just kinda kept learning topics, until I one day ended up with my own compiler as an answer to a job interview question. I figure that's kinda where it plateaus.

But what keeps me going is the prospect of a 3D force directed graph visualization I'm writing, <a href="https://github.com/mooreolith/auto-graph">&lt;auto-graph&gt;</a>. Some other work I'm proud of is this concept app called es.ipynb, which creates a Jupyter-like notebook for client side javascript. Now I can write small, isolated experiments for browser javascript, which before would have required setting up a simple page.
