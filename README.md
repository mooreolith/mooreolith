# Welcome

I'm Josh, and here are some projects I've been working on for reference, for friends and family, as well as myself, for future endeavors. 

Some of the latest two: 
 * [todo-app](https://github.com/mooreolith/todo-app), you'll find a description of 3-Tier architecture using a CRUD app: todo-app
 * [todo-app-docker](https://github.com/mooreolith/todo-app-docker), containerizes the previous todo app

Enjoy!
