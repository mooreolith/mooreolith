mooreolith, the most recent github account for Joshua Marshall Moore, Senior Software Developer (highest level of incompetence). 
I currently live in North Las Vegas, Nevada with my parents, so I keep busy writing software. 

I'm enamored with the idea of writing a graph web component, and then creating graphs of software. I think programs would be really interesting to look at. I majored in Computer Science and Software Engineering before dropping out of Engineering school. Not to start a business or something, it was just a rough time in my life. I figure programs can be visualizaed in terms of data flow through a graph, or even just a call graph. Or an amalgamation of the two, like layers visible and invisble. 

You can reach me at mooreolith@proton.me. 

I just finished a genetic programming experiment. Morphing strings into other strings. Honestly, the result looks like magic. I'll include a link as soon as it's up.
