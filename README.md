Welcome to this Joshua Moore’s portfolio page. I’m a Las Vegas based software developer mainly handcrafting Vanilla Javascript, CSS, and HTML. These are a few recent rewrites and new additions. 
* [Eight Queens](https://mooreolith.github.io/eight-queens), ([code](https://github.com/mooreolith/eight-queens))
My late father (may he rest in peace) passed down to me his love for chess, and a riddle called the Eight Queens Problem. The aim is to place eight queens (which can move up/down, left/right, and diagonally, you can use 8 pawns) on a chess board so that no queen can capture another. Click the fields to place a queen, click it again, to remove it. Trial and error it, or reason it out. There are multiple solutions.

* [Notebook](https://mooreolith.github.io/notebook), ([code](https://github.com/mooreolith/notebook))
Born out of the need to conduct small experiments when implementing larger projects, I found myself wanting for a javascript notebook. The Jupyter Notebook which inspired this project deals with server side languages, whereas I specifically wanted something for client side (browser) Javascript. The two following links contain references to two example notebooks. 

* [Soundtrack](https://mooreolith.github.io/soundtrack), ([code](https://github.com/mooreolith/soundtrack/))
  Soundtrack is a browser based mp3 player. This program grew out of my frustration with ever so slightly off feature sets in various mp3 players. This is just what I need: A list of mp3 tracks from my hard drive I can play, filtered by artist, album or title. Upload a folder to the app (nothing leaves your browser), wait for the mp3 files to parse, and double click a song to start playback.
